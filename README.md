[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is one of the most popular platforms for competitive programming. Each month there are conducted dozens of contests with thousands of participants, including us.

We decided to give back to this amazing community by creating **algois.me** - nice and user-friendly Android & IOS application, which leverages Codeforces API to bring more competitive programming to Android & IOS devices. algois.me allows:
1. **Watch for activity** of any Codeforces user.
2. **Sort users** by rating and last participation date.
3. Shortlist and register for **upcoming Codeforces contests**.
4. Follow **Recent Actions**.
5. Browse and search for **Problems**.
